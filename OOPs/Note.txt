What is Class
a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.


**Object**: An instance of a class. Objects have attributes and behavior as defined by the class.

Attribute: A variable that belongs to a class or an instance of a class.

Method: A function that is defined inside a class and operates on instances of that class.
